      <h2>About Rainy Brain</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">
        Rainy Brain is a web application with a Machine Learning model that predicts whether it
         will rain the next day, based on the Rain Prediction in Australia dataset. The project's code is 
         available in my <a href="https://github.com/zeeza18/Australian-Rain-Predictor.git" 
         style="color: black; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
          GitHub repository</a>. Over 80% of Australia receives less than 600 mm of annual rainfall, 
         the lowest among all continents except Antarctica. For example, areas near Lake Eyre receive only about 81 mm
         yearly, while the Australian desert averages between 81 and 250 mm. Despite the low rainfall, thunderstorms are fairly 
         common, with 15 to 20 annually. In southern Australia, westerly winds and rain-bearing cold fronts are 
         typical in winter, causing frosts inland but mild temperatures near the coast. Summers are hot and dry with
         coastal breezes, but prolonged dry spells can lead to bushfires, especially in Victoria and New South Wales.
          Northern Australia experiences a wet season from October to April due to the monsoon, bringing showers, 
          thunderstorms, and occasionally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, reaching further inland.

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard was created using PowerBI, a software product by Microsoft. 
        I've included images of the dashboard here, as PowerBI requires an organizational account. 
        To view the interactive visualizations, you can download my 
        <a href="../static/rain.pbix" style="color: black; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">PowerBI</a> dashboard file. 
        You'll need PowerBI software to open the file. Dashboards like this one help provide a better
         understanding of the dataset and reveal valuable insights.</p>

        <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;"> 
          Hi, I'm Azeez, aspiring to become an AI Engineer üöÄ based in Bengaluru, India. 
          I have hands-on experience as an AI Engineer Intern, working for six months at AI Robosoft. 
          During my internship, I focused on projects involving Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
          Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. Currently, I'm actively engaged 
          in self-paced projects such as Rain Prediction, Flight Prediction, and Skin Disease Analyzer. 
          These projects allow me to apply my skills and deepen my understanding of AI applications. 
          Outside of work, I enjoy gaming and watching YouTube. Feel free to connect
           with me through my social media links below</p>
